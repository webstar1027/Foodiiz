            <h3>5. Reservation and Billing Arrangements </h3>
            <p>As a registered User, each Guest is welcome to make an online reservation with any Host offering his services via Foodiiz's Site (“Reservation”). A Guest may pay for the Reservation by using our Online Payment Processors (as defined below). As part of the Reservation process the Guest will be asked to fill in some details with respect to his/her Reservation (such as the food he/she wishes to have and food and/or other allergies, if any) (“Contact Form”). The Contact Form you have filled in will be delivered automatically to your respective Host. Please note that we do not keep such information, and it is your responsibility, and not ours, to inform your Host, in each Reservation you make through the Site, regarding your food and/or other allergies and/or other information you wish to provide your Host. </p>
            <p>Once your Reservation is confirmed by the Host, the Company will notify you by email that your Reservation is confirmed (“Reservation Confirmation”) and then will charge you for the full service amount which is transferred to the Host (the “Reservation Fee”) plus a service fee of the abovementioned Reservation Fee (the “ Service Fee”) (the “Reservation Fee” and the “Service Fee” shall be referred to collectively as the “Reservation Amount”). The price which is indicated in the Site reflects the Reservation Amount. The Reservation Amount charged from the Guest will be kept faithfully by Foodiiz and in compliance with any applicable law, and the Reservation Fee will only be transferred to the respective Host up to five (5) business days following your arrival to your reserved Food Event and provided that no cancellation notification was made by you before that day (please see our Cancelation Policy here: <a href="https://foodiiz.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/209948845-What-is-the-guest-cancellation-policy-" target="_blank">https://foodiiz.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/209948845-What-is-the-guest-cancellation-policy-</a>. The Host appoints Foodiiz as the Host's limited agent solely for the purpose of collecting payment made by Guests on behalf of the Host.</p>
            <h3>6.  Fees and Payments </h3>
            <p>Payments may be processed via certain online payment service providers (“Online Payment Processors”). We may add or change the Online Payment Processors in our sole discretion. The Online Payment Processors enable you to send payments securely online using a credit card, debit card or bank account. We do not control and are not affiliated with such Online Payment Processors. These Online Payment Processors are independent contractors and have no employment or agency relationship with Foodiiz. Foodiiz is not responsible in any way for the actions or performance (or lack thereof) of the Online Payment Processors. The use of the Online Payment Processors is at your own risk. It is your responsibility to abide by all the terms specified by the Online Payment Processors in their terms of use and privacy policies. You acknowledge that you are fully assuming the risks of conducting any transactions via the Online Payment Processors. </p>
            <p>Hosts are required to post prices including all applicable taxes for Reservation of Food Events they offer on Foodiiz, as such Reservation may be subject to taxation, as required or ordered by the applicable tax law in the country in which respective Hosts reside. Hosts are solely responsible to determine the applicable taxes and are hereby required to comply with the applicable tax law and pay any taxes including VAT, surcharges, sales taxes, goods and services taxes, and other similar municipal, state and federal indirect or other withholding and personal or corporate income taxes imposed and levied in connection with Reservations made of their respective Food Events via Foodiiz's Site and Services or the payment thereof and they represent and warrant that they will pay such taxes in time and in compliance with the applicable tax law.</p>
            <p>Note that failing to pay such taxes, as ordered by applicable tax law, or failing to comply with any provisions specified in the applicable tax law may prevent such Hosts from continuing publishing their Food Events on Foodiiz's Site.</p>
            <p>You, as a Guest, represent and warrant that you will pay to your Host all fees and taxes incurred with your Reservation in a timely manner and in compliance with Foodiiz's fee schedule. Failing to settle your payments including any taxes incurred with your Reservation, will prevent you from executing your Reservation with Foodiiz's Site and from further using Foodiiz's Site and Services.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the above, Company shall reserve the right, but have no obligation, to withhold any applicable taxes and obtain any other remedies available by law.</p>
            <p>The Company may, at any time and at its sole discretion, amend the fee schedule, payment terms and cancellation policy specified on the Site. Any such changes will take effect immediately after being posted on Foodiiz's Site. Foodiiz may deduct foreign currency processing costs from any payment.</p>
            <p>Foodiiz may provide a feature through which Users may view the Reservation Amounts in foreign currencies. This information is believed to be accurate, but we do not warrant or guarantee such accuracy. You hereby agree and acknowledge that these views of fees are for your convenience and informational purposes only. You acknowledge that the applicable exchange rate used for currency conversion processing may not be identical to the applicable market rate in effect at the specific time such processing occurs.</p>

            <p>Your Reservation shall be deemed canceled only upon receipt of Foodiiz confirmation of your cancellation. The Company reserves the right to cancel a Reservation at any time upon returning full refund of Reservation Amount to the Guest.  </p>
            <p>In case a Host cancels Guest’s Reservation to participate in a Food Event, Company will credit Guest with the full Reservation Amount such Guest has paid to Foodiiz. Foodiiz reserves the right to charge the canceling Host with the Service Fees. Foodiiz shall not bear any liability for any cost, expense, loss or damage that you may suffer or incur as a result of Host’s or Guest’s cancelation of a Reservation of Food Event.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Foodiiz reserves the right to charge back from Hosts the Reservation Fee they received for organizing certain Food Event if upon the receipt of a complaint by a Guest with respect to such Food Event, Foodiiz believes, at its sole discretion, that such Food Event was not compatible with Foodiiz standards of service, including in compliance with this Terms, or in case of any misconduct of the Host. </p>
